The project is implemented in Python 3
Command to run the file- python code.py 

Install the following python libraries:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
5. scipy

Make sure scipy.fft.fft function is setup properly, sometimes when run using anaconda it gives error.Works fine in Google colab and Pycharm.
The code has well written comments guiding through the different parts of the project.
